# ReReddit
A simple Reddit clone with upvote and downvotes

## Functionality
1. Maintain a list of topics and its upvotes/downvotes
2. Allow the user to upvote or downvote a topic. For this challenge, the user may upvote or downvote the same topic multiple times.
3. Always return a list of top 20 topics (sorted by upvotes, descending) on the homepage
4. In-memory: in-memory data structure (shared by the same process as your application) that will allow you to keep the topics in memory without using data persistence

## Branches
**master** -> Most shippable product   
**development** -> Work In Progress

## Build
**Requirement** : Xcode 8 + and Swift 3  
No cocoapods required, just clone the project, build and run
